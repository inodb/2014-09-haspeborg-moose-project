-   The library with the most errors
    `5_121030_BD1FJ4ACXX_P272_102_index7_1_fastqc.html
    <5_121030_BD1FJ4ACXX_P272_102_index7_1_fastqc.html>`_ is indeed one that
    had problems according to the Sequencing Facility.
-   Most of the libraries have some
    problems with overabundant kmers. Could be adapter sequences in some cases
    because they are mostly found at the start or end of reads e.g.:
    `6_120921_BC16HYACXX_P272_105_index10_1_fastqc.html#M11
    <6_120921_BC16HYACXX_P272_105_index10_1_fastqc.html#M11>`_. In other cases the
    kmers are mostly distributed equally over the entire position, so maybe it is
    just high 7mer abundance of a certain species then.
-   There are some with strange GC content peaks possibly due to high
    abundance of a certain microbe(s):
    `3_120921_BC16HYACXX_P272_102_index7_1_fastqc.html#M5
    <3_120921_BC16HYACXX_P272_102_index7_1_fastqc.html#M5>`_.
